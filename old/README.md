# GigatronTTL-Fractals
Hobby code development for Gigatron TTL microcomputer - Fractals

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its all about fractals. Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship. You get them in two formats. Integer or Floating Point.

And there is more to choose from individual fractals or all in one programs. There are Ascii and Graphics fractals. They are drawn line by line or random dot.

Most generic fractal code uses floating point math and is very accurate. For example this follows pretty much the code used in wikipedia. You can get big picture size and can zoom in a lot. Only downside with floating point is the calculation speed is very slow.

These all in one fractal programs fpfract2, ascfract and rndfract use floating point math.

Ascii fractals for fast test and benchmarking. Fpfract is the same but with graphics.

Other way to use fractals is to draw them with random dot.

Gfx mandelbrot (16 iterations) uses floating point and takes 2 hours 5 minutes to draw the screen. With latest compiler 1 hour 31 minutes.

Gfx julia uses (16 iterations) floating point and takes 1 hour 50 minutes to draw the screen. With latest compiler 1 hour 8 minutes.

Extended version of gfx mandelbrot (64 iterations) uses floating point and takes 4,5 hours to draw the screen. With latest compiler 4 hours 12 minutes.
Extended version of gfx julia uses (64 iterations) floating point and takes 3 hours to draw the screen. With latest compiler might be even faster.

Ascii mandelbrot (11 iterations) uses floating point and takes 2 min 1 sec to draw the screen. With latest compiler 1 min 38 sec.

Ascii julia (11 iterations) uses floating point and takes 1 min 55 sec to draw the screen. With latest compiler 1 min 35 sec.

Ascii burning ship (11 iterations) uses floating point and takes 1 min 44 sec to draw the screen. With latest compiler 1 min 35 sec.
